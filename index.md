Hi! I am Chenxiao, a PhD student at [Toyota Technological Insitute at Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu), an independent philanthropically endowed computer science research institute located on the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) campus. I am fortunate to be advised by [Zhiyuan Li](http://zhiyuanli.ttic.edu) and to collaborate closely with [David McAllester](https://home.ttic.edu/~dmcallester/) and [Nathan Srebro](https://nati.ttic.edu). I also occasionally spend time visiting the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu). Previously, I was a research intern at [Amazon Web Services](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/ailab/), mentored by [David Wipf](http://www.davidwipf.com/). I received both my M.S. and B.S. degrees from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), where I worked with [Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn). 

My primary research interests include:

* **Reasoning & Planning with LLMs**: I work from first principles to develop understandings of why current LLMs achive success and where they fundamentally fall short. In doing so, I seek to design methods to push them toward accomplishing harder tasks â€” faster, cheaper, and with results we can verify. I am also drawn to associated philosophical questions that arise as AI systems are outperforming humans across more domains.

* **Machine Learning Theory**: Theoretically, I explore how training dynamics and architectural inductive biases synergize to produce generalizable solutions. I am particularly interested in out-of-distribution settings, which is common in graph learning (since samples are interdependent) and becomes increasingly important in the LLM era.

* **Graph Learning**: I investigate surprising phenomena in graph learning, seek to understand their underlying causes, and translate these insights into simple yet powerful graph-based models. 

Though I do not actively work on, I also maintain side interests in causal inference, generative models (e.g., diffusion models), and machine-learning applications for scientific discovery and data mining.


## Recent News

* I will be giving talks at FLaNN (May 26) and ASAP (May 27) seminars.
* Two papers were accepted in ICML 2025! One about the theoretical limitation of CoT and a new LLM reasoning paradigm, another about a principled graph transformer from advective diffusion PDE perspective.
