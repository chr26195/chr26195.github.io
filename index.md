<!-- ## Biography -->

Hi, this is Chenxiao. I am an incoming PhD student at [Toyota Technological Insitute at Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu) where I will be working with [Zhiyuan Li](http://zhiyuanli.ttic.edu). Before this, I was a research intern at [Amazon Web Services](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/ailab/) working with [David Wipf](http://www.davidwipf.com/). I completed my Master's degree at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn) in 2024, under the supervision of [Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn). I also earned my Bachelor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2021. 


<!-- My research interests include

* Psychology of Language Models

<!-- I am generally interested in developing methodological principles and theoretical understandings of machine learning. I did so by drawing inspirations from optimization, statistics, geometry and topology. I am concerned with applications including data mining, computational biology, and large language models. -->

<!-- I am broadly interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. My current research spans entire theory-to-application spectrum, from answering fundamental questions regarding the **theoretical interpretability** of deep learning and foundation models from optimization perspectives, to **principled algorithms** for handling distribution shifts and adapting to new tasks by drawing inspirations from causality and physics, to **real-world applications** including bioinformatives and large-scale systems for both scientific advances and social goodness.  -->
