<!-- ## Biography -->

Hi, this is Chenxiao. I am currently a research intern at [Amazon Web Services](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/ailab/) working with [David Wipf](http://www.davidwipf.com/). Prior to this, I completed my M.S. at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn) in 2024, under the supervision of [Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn). I earned my B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2021. ~~I am interested in things that interest me.~~


<!-- I am generally interested in developing methodological principles and theoretical understandings of machine learning. I did so by drawing inspirations from optimization, statistics, geometry and topology. I am concerned with applications including data mining, computational biology, and large language models. -->

<!-- I am broadly interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. My current research spans entire theory-to-application spectrum, from answering fundamental questions regarding the **theoretical interpretability** of deep learning and foundation models from optimization perspectives, to **principled algorithms** for handling distribution shifts and adapting to new tasks by drawing inspirations from causality and physics, to **real-world applications** including bioinformatives and large-scale systems for both scientific advances and social goodness.  -->
